    <p>Dear Employee,</p>
<p>As you have certainly noticed, these unprecedented times are creating chaos across the fine boundary that separates our personal and professional lives. Far from being an orderly and productive endeavor, working from home often means increased stress as we all deal with the needs of our families and jobs. We recognize that this places an enormous amount of stress on you.</p>
<p>We work in a service economy. This means that most employees of most companies, including this one, are paid based on the value they deliver to the business (and not simply on the number of hours that they sit at a desk). Therefore, despite mounting evidence to the contrary, it is crucial that you continue to sit at your virtual desk for at least 40 hours a week.</p>
<p>We realize that this is challenging: you&rsquo;re contending with kids who need schooling, a house that needs tending to, and relatives that may require your care. Added to all of this is the looming stress that we are all feeling during this time. Nonetheless, we must remind you that you are expected to be physically sitting at your desk, ready to attend Zoom meetings that could have been emails at a moment&rsquo;s notice. Your fellow coworkers must be able to get in immediate touch with you for their artificially urgent needs, and we must continue to measure productivity in ways that are wildly out of touch with the work that you actually do.</p>
<p>We thank you for your commitment to our organization, and hope that you are able to realize your kid will be just fine if you skip thier math lesson so that you can attend the semi-quarterly strategic global marketing roundtable.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Your boss, who is sending you this email at 10PM to demonstrate the type of work ethic that should be your &ldquo;new normal&rdquo;</p>
