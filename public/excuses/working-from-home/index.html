    <p>To our valued, hard-working employees,</p>
<p>As a leadership team, we are happy to say that our company has been doing extraordinarily well during this unprecedented time. We are impressed with your dedication and ability to not only do your job from home, but sometimes vastly exceed expectations. We have received questions from a number of you about whether or not this can be a permanent change once things begin to prematurely re-open.</p>
<p>This is a fair question. Many of you are asking out of selflessness: you interact with at-risk family members and do not want to put them in harms way, or you have children that you are concerned about. Others have expressed that they feel healthier without a 2 hour commute each day, and have experienced a greater sense of overall happiness and productivity in the absence of our 21st century open office (which comes complete with artifical conversations playing over the speakers at all times).</p>
<p>Rest assured that your leadership team is commited to your health and wellbeing. We will regularly discuss this issue to determine the best strategic and tactical direction for our company to take with regard to this matter. You can expect a vague non-answer to this question sometime in the next several months, maybe.</p>
<p>We recognize that other companies, such as Google and Facebook, have committed to indefinite work from home for their employees. We do feel obligated to remind you that, while we expect you to perform as well as employees at those companies, we ourselves are not those companies (see: our pay rates). Therefore, we cannot base our decisions on what those companies are doing. These are unprecedented times, and we must continue to stress the unusual nature of our circumstances instead of giving actual answers to your questions.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Your Director of Human Resources, who is dedicated to an answer-free workplace</p>
