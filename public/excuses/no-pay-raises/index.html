    <p>Dear valued employee who received a perfect score on their appraisal,</p>
<p>First and foremost, I want to thank you for your continued dedication to the nebulous values of our company that you received on a business card during your orientation a few years ago. It&rsquo;s employees like you that drive innovation and excellence within our company. Your efforts throughout this year have earned you the respect of your peers, delivered business value that far exceeds your salary, and set us up for future success. Additionally, your commitment to working 70 hours a week now that you are stuck at home while still maintaining a household does not go unrecognized.</p>
<p>These are unprecedented times in our economy, and they require us to take unprecedented measures. That is why we will be suspending the just-barely-above-inflation merit pay raise that you would normally receive for your efforts until further notice. We hope that we can reinstate this just as soon as we begin to make even more money than we were making before this pandemic.</p>
<p>We have always believed, and continue to believe, that our employees do not choose to be a member of this family simply because of the pay. You work here because you want to change the world and be surrounded by like-minded individuals that share these same values. Being able to put food on your table, fund your leisure activities, and put a roof over your head is simply an added bonus to being able to realize your full life potential.</p>
<p>We appreciate your understanding and dedication to our organization.</p>
<p>Very Sincerely Yours,</p>
<p>Your Manager, who looks forward to using the phrase &ldquo;unprecedented times&rdquo; again in a few months to explain why your raise is so small.</p>
