    <p>Dear valued employee of a business division that I didn&rsquo;t like anyway,</p>
<p>During this unprecedented time in human history, our company is being forced to make incredibly challenging decisions. Faced with the prospect of challenging economic times for the forseeable future, our leadership team has had to spend a great deal of time considering our strategic alignment with the needs of our customers.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, after many long hours of repeating the words &ldquo;strategic,&rdquo; &ldquo;differentiator,&rdquo; and &ldquo;go to market,&rdquo; the leadership team has made the difficult decision to dissolve your area of the business. We came to this decision several months before COVID-19, but this global pandemic has given us the cover that we need to remove you and those under you with the least impact on overall employee morale. We hope that you understand.</p>
<p>We realize that this may come as a shock, and that you may be feeling a strong mix of emotions. Many of you were in the middle of important projects that the leadership team has not taken the time to understand. Rest assured that your work will be delegated to other employees who are already struggling under a mountain of existing work and general stress due to our global situation.</p>
<p>Thank you again for your commitment to our organization during your tenure. You have shown us an incredible amount of dedication, and we are honored to fail to do the same for you.</p>
<p>Very Sincerely Yours,</p>
<p>Your CEO, who is thankful to China for supplying us with cheap labor and this convenient, viral excuse to chop off one of our company&rsquo;s limbs.</p>
