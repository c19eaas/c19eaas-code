COVID-19 Excuse as a Service is changing the way people handle interactions with each other. We're disrupting the norms of civility, rearchitecting the functions of social interaction, and enabling difficult conversations during a difficult time. With at least one person that we have spoken to claiming that we have at least a $1 billion valuation, we believe that you will not want to miss out on an opportunity to invest in our unprecedented product.

<h2>Our Technology Stack</h2>

Our leadership team has a rich history of technological excellence, having attended many Udemy classes on modern webscale practices. This expertise has led to a hand-crafted technology stack that is unparalleled by any other Excuse as a Service vendor. Some highlights of our stack include:

<ul>
  <li><i class="fas fa-code"></i> Modern languages: A backend written entirely in Go, through the use of the Hugo framework. Go is a modern language for the 21st Century DevOps world.</li>
  <li><i class="fas fa-code-branch"></i> A deep commitment to open source: not only is our codebase on Github, but the entire application is hosted by Github pages. We also encourage our users to submit their own COVID-19 Excuses via a DevSecGitOps Pull Request to the <a href="https://github.com/c19eaas/c19eaas-code">repository.</a></li>
  <li><i class="fas fa-cloud"></i> Infinite scalability: Speaking of Github pages, this means that we don't incur any costs for hosting of our services.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Projected Growth</h2>

With the growth in COVID comes a natural growth in the need for excuses. COVID-19 Excuse as a Service fills this organic void. This has lead to explosive growth in our business. Below is our latest growth projection. We commit to keeping this updated as the situation develops.
