Dear valued employee,

We are living through extraordinary times. The unprecedented events brought forth by COVID-19 have impacted businesses large and small. Neighborhood stores run by small families have been forced to close after decades in business, while large corporations have been forced to adjust their imaginary growth projections for their shareholders. Clearly, nobody is immune to this pandemic.

A few short weeks ago, I stood in front of you and showed you graphs and charts that represented our tremendous financial growth. Unfortunately, if I were to show you those same graphs and charts today, you would notice that the line isn't increasing quite as quickly as it was previously. Unfortunately, we simply cannot allow this to happen. Therefore, I have no choice but to make the incredibly difficult decision to let you go from our great company.

I'm sure you have many questions, and I would like to be transparent about our financial situation as a token of goodwill before you leave. It might be confusing to you that a company can do so well for so long, and still be unable to weather a few months of hardship. Allow me to explain. While individual people are expected to take sensible risks that will not endanger their personal lives in the event of a few months of hardship, a company like ours is under no such obligation. We risked big by spending beyond our means, throwing lavish sales parties, and failing to ever consider that anything bad would literally ever happen in the history of our company. We must now accept the consequences of those choices. And by we, I mean you. Myself and the rest of the leadership team will face no consequences for putting us in this situation to begin with.

Rest assured, we will take care of you. We know that you put in long hours, gave up personal time with your family, and endured incredible stress so that we could make a few more bucks. That's why we're agreeing to not immediately decimate your healthcare. We will also send a few messages to our connections on LinkedIn (and encourage other employees to do the same) in an effort to help you land on your feet.

This is the most difficult decision that I've ever had to make, and I do not make it lightly. You will be greatly missed, and we appreciate your understanding that the growth line must always go up and to the right.

Very Sincerely Yours,

Your CEO, whose decision to not take a salary could have saved at least 5 human beings from worrying about where their next paycheck would come from.
