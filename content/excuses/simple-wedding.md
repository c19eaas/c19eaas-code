To our beloved family and friends,

As many of you are aware, we were planning to get married this year. We couldn't wait to celebrate with each and every one of you as we set ourselves up for our new lives saddled with over $20,000 in wedding-related debt so that you could enjoy an open bar and gourmet food while still criticizing our choice in centerpiece.

Unfortunately, COVID-19 has put a damper on our planned ceremonies. While we have the option to push the wedding back until next year, the uncertainty surrounding these unprecedented times has led us to consider other options. As such, we have decided to get married in a small ceremony with only our close friends (it turns out there aren't many of them).

While we know that you will gossip about our decision and talk smack to our other relatives, we appreciate your understanding during this trying time. We hope that you can share in our love from (a far less expensive) distance.

Sincerely,

Marriage Unit 1 and Marriage Unit 2
